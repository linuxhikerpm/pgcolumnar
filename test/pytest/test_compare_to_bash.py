"""`compare_to_bash.py` must read the assertion's NAME, not some other argument (#432).

The parity tool is what decides whether a port is one-for-one with its bash suite, which
is #432's definition of done. So the tool is a claim like any other, and it was wrong in a
way that pointed directly at the work it grades.

THE DEFECT. The python side was matched with a regex:

    expect\\.\\w+\\([^)]*?"([^"]+)"\\s*(?:,[^)]*)?\\)

`[^)]*?` is lazy, so it stopped at the FIRST quoted argument. For `expect.num(got, 1,
NAME)` that is the name, and the tool looked correct on every arm anyone checked. For a
helper whose WANT is itself a string it is not:

    expect.sqlstate(err, "42501", NAME)   -> read "42501" as the name
    expect.text(got, "none", NAME)        -> read "none"

Every SQLSTATE assertion was therefore read as the literal `42501`, reported as an "extra"
name the bash suite does not have, while the real property was reported MISSING. #432's
ports are precisely the ones replacing a grep on an error message with a SQLSTATE
assertion, so the tool went blind in proportion to the work being done well. Measured over
the seven pairs in the tree: **61 bash properties reported missing, of which 34 were not
missing at all.** Two whole pairs flipped from `PORT IS INCOMPLETE` to complete.

WHY A GUARD AND NOT JUST A FIX. Nothing could see this. The tool's own output was the only
evidence either way, and its verdict for a correct port was a plausible-looking list of
names that really were absent from the port -- absent because the tool had matched a
different string, which is not visible from the list. `test_hilbert_locality.py` records
somebody working around it by rewriting their test file until the count fell, and
concluding the rest needed a change to this tool. It did.

THE ARMS BELOW DRIVE THE REAL EXTRACTORS, never a copy. A python twin of a python rule
would agree with itself.

# `COMPLETE` is graded by the standing arm below: every one must reach zero MISSING.
# `INCOMPLETE` is how a pair that does NOT reach zero is declared, with the reason,
# rather than being absent.
#
# WHY A DECLARATION AND NOT JUST A DERIVED LIST. Grading whatever exists would pin a
# real gap as the expected state, which the standing arm's docstring has always
# refused. Declaring the gap instead keeps the refusal and removes the silence: the
# arm asserts that COMPLETE + INCOMPLETE is exactly the set of pairs in the tree, so
#
#     a new COMPLETE pair omitted     reddens, with the stem named
#     a new INCOMPLETE pair omitted   reddens, with the stem named
#     a known gap                     declared with its reason, does not redden
#     a declared pair that vanishes   reddens
#
# IT DOES FORBID ONE THING, and the issue said this was the decision to make rather than
# assume: today an INCOMPLETE pair may land declaring NOTHING and nothing reddens. Here
# it must carry a stem and a reason. That is a new obligation on a real case -- the
# escape hatch is attached rather than the case forbidden, but a porter who lands a pair
# that does not reach zero now has to say so. Named by @OffgridwithJD, who pointed out
# that "forbids nothing that was allowed before" was the comfortable phrasing and the
# accurate one is "forbids nothing EXCEPT landing an incomplete pair silently", which is
# the thing this guard exists about.
#
# THE COST TODAY IS ZERO, measured on 20bc290: 8 pairs exist, 8 are declared, 0 exist
# undeclared and 0 are declared without existing. `INCOMPLETE` starts empty and the first
# person it costs is the next porter, who is the person it is for.
#
# Until #1046 the list was hand-written
# and nothing enforced it: the set happened to equal the tree, so nothing had ever been
# silently ungraded, and an eighth pair omitted would have left the arm passing while it
# graded seven -- absent-from-the-list and no-gap-found producing the same green.
#
# The shape is `SHELL_REFERENCES`' in `test_harness_deps.py`, asserted in both
# directions for the same reason: a one-way list rots into a permanent exemption.

    The standing arm below grades the pairs it is GIVEN. Until this arm existed, a pair
    that existed and was not given to it was not graded, and nothing said so: the arm
    passed, grading the ones it knew about, and reported a clean verdict for a tree it
    had not fully looked at. **Absent-from-the-list and no-gap-found produced the same
    green.**

    Latent rather than live throughout: the declared set happened to equal the tree, so
    nothing had ever been silently ungraded. It would have gone live the moment a ninth
    pair landed undeclared, which is a thing a porter does by forgetting one line.

    BOTH DIRECTIONS, for the reason `SHELL_REFERENCES` gives in `test_harness_deps.py`:
    a declaration asserted one way rots into a permanent exemption. A pair that exists
    and is not declared reddens; a stem declared for a pair that has been deleted
    reddens too.

    A PAIR IS `test_<stem>.py` BESIDE `test/<stem>.sh`, derived from the tree rather
    than listed. 24 pytest files have no matching suite -- the harness's own guards --
    and are correctly not pairs; deriving the population is what keeps them out without
    a second exemption list to maintain.

    """THE STANDING ARM, and the reason this file is not only about fixtures.

    A guard over invented sources proves the extractor reads python. It cannot prove the
    tool grades THIS tree, which is the claim #432 rests on. So the pairs that are declared
    complete are asserted complete here, and a later edit that breaks parity fails with the
    pair named rather than the whole gate going red for an unrelated reason.

    Only the pairs that reach zero today are listed. A pair with a real gap is not pinned to
    its gap: that would turn the gap into the expected state.

    THE LIST IS HAND-WRITTEN FOR THAT REASON AND NOTHING ENFORCES IT, which is a
    different thing from the reason being wrong. The comment below already says a new
    port belongs here; no arm reddens when one does not arrive. Today the list happens
    to equal the pairs that exist, so nothing has ever been silently ungraded -- but an
    eighth complete pair omitted would leave this arm passing while it graded seven,
    which is absent-from-the-list and no-gap-found producing the same green.

    #1046 TRACKS MAKING THIS ASSERTION TWO-DIRECTIONAL, in the shape `SHELL_REFERENCES`
    already uses: derive the pairs that EXIST and require the declared list to equal that
    set. It is not a tidy-up -- it changes what happens to an INCOMPLETE port, which is
    quietly absent today and would have to redden, so the issue records the design
    question rather than settling it. Kept out of the PR that added the eighth pair.
