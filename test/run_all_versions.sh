# pgColumnar multi-version build-and-test matrix.
#
# For each pg_config given, this builds the extension fresh in a per-major build
# directory (so nothing leaks between majors) and runs every suite
# (smoke + phase2..phase6 + audit + concurrency + unique_conc + differential +
# recovery + fuzz) against it. It prints a
# per-version PASS/FAIL line and
# a final summary table, and exits non-zero if any version fails to build or any
# suite fails.
#
# Usage:
#   test/run_all_versions.sh [PG_CONFIG ...]
#
# With no arguments it uses a default list covering PostgreSQL 15 through 19.
# PostgreSQL 13 (end of life) and 14 are no longer in the default matrix.
# Each PG_CONFIG must point at an assert-enabled build to exercise the asserts.
# Run as a user that may "runuser -u postgres" (e.g. root); the suites start
# throwaway clusters as the postgres OS user.
#
# Written fresh for pgColumnar. It reuses no upstream test harness.

# One name per line, and it must stay that way.
#
# This was a single backslash-continued line, so every pull request that adds a
# suite edited the same line and any two of them conflicted by construction. It
# happened four times in one day (#459 vs #462, #460 vs #462, #462 vs #468, and
# #444 behind them) and four more times the night #446, #468 and #444 landed.
#
# The resolution was the dangerous part, not the conflict. Appending the new name
# after the closing paren is valid shell that `bash -n` accepts, and it does not
# merely leave a stray command: `NAME=value cmd` scopes the assignment to that
# command, and an array literal is no exception, so `SUITES=(...) my_suite` leaves
# SUITES UNSET and the matrix runs nothing at all. harness_selftest pins that (#469).
#
# One name per line means two pull requests adding two suites touch two different
# lines and merge cleanly. Do not re-flow this into one line to save space.

#
# Both guards exist because both failures happened, and neither announced

#
# bash reads a script incrementally as it executes it, so editing this file
# while a run is in progress corrupts the run in place. A gate died at
# "line 139: `done'" with the file on disk perfectly valid, because the bytes
# had moved under the interpreter between one read and the next. Re-executing
# from a copy makes an in-flight run immune to whatever happens to the original.
#
# And two runs at once quietly ruin each other: they contend for clusters and
# ports, and the symptom is a suite failing with no named check -- a wall of
# ERROR: database "regress" already exists and a red result that looks exactly
# like a real one. Three false reds in one day were traced to this. A run now
# leaves a lock naming its pid, so the second one says so and stops instead of
# producing a result nobody can trust.

# silently never ran. Asking the runner means there is one parser, bash's, and

declare -a SUMMARY

# Suites whose checks compare wall-clock times, and which therefore cannot be run
# beside five others.
#
# The rest of the matrix runs PGC_JOBS suites at once, each with its own cluster,
# so every ratio in those suites is measured under six-way contention. That is
# not a fixture problem and no threshold survives it: the same check on the same
# build measures 1.11 alone and 2.11 inside the matrix, against a bound of 2.0.
# Three suites produced red gates that way in one session, each costing a re-run
# to disprove, which is how a matrix teaches its readers to discount red.
#
# Tuning the fixtures was tried first and does not work. On the group-doubling
# check, raising the fetch count to dilute the shared decode makes the ratio
# worse rather than better -- 1.08 at 6,000 fetches, 1.23 at 20,000, 1.29 at
# 40,000 -- because per-fetch cost is itself a function of group size, so more
# fetches amplify the difference instead of averaging it away. The comment in
# native_fetch_position.sh that recommended exactly that has been corrected.
#
# Not every wall-clock ratio belongs here, and the distinction is measurable
# rather than a matter of taste. native_fetch_cache asserts one on the same
# index-driven fetch with the same stopwatch, and is deliberately absent: it
# compares one big group against ten small ones, and the cache equalises
# per-fetch cost across both sides, so contention is common-mode and cancels in
# the ratio. Measured, six-way: absolute times roughly doubled and the ratio
# stayed near 1 against a bound of 3, worst case 1.15.
#
# The three below measure quantities whose per-fetch or per-query cost is itself
# a function of the thing being varied, so contention is differential and does
# not cancel. That is the test for membership: does the load move both sides of
# the ratio together?
#
# So they run alone. It costs a few minutes per major and it buys a timing
# result that means something.

# Suites that must not run beside five others, which is a wider set than the
# timing ones and for a second reason.
#
# The timing suites are here because a wall-clock ratio cannot be measured under
# contention. replication is here because it is heavy rather than because it
# measures anything: it stands up a SECOND cluster, runs pg_basebackup, and
# streams between the two, so at PGC_JOBS=6 it is competing with six other
# clusters for the same box. It failed roughly one full matrix in three, on a
# different major each time -- PG18, then PG19, then PG16 -- which is the
# signature of resource contention rather than a defect in the suite or the
# major.
#
# Deliberately NOT the same predicate as is_timing_suite, because
# PGC_SKIP_TIMING drops those in CI and replication must still run there. Serial
# and skipped are different properties and were one list until this suite needed
# one without the other.
# planner_choice_quality is here THROUGH is_timing_suite, not beside it, and
# this comment used to say the opposite (#764): "deliberately not in
# is_timing_suite: its premises are plan-shape assertions, and those are worth
# running in CI". It is in that list, so under PGC_SKIP_TIMING the driver does
# not invoke the suite at all and none of those plan-shape assertions runs in
# CI. A reader who found this comment believed they did.
#
# The entry in is_timing_suite is the correct half and its own comment says why:
# left out of that list the suite RAN, dropped the ratio, and reported PASS on
# its premises alone, so a regression of #434 would have been green from the
# suite that exists to catch it. Confirmed by running it directly with
# PGC_SKIP_TIMING=1: PASSED, 7 checks, only the two wall-clock ratios skipped.
#
# The coverage that costs -- no plan-shape assertion from this suite in CI -- is
# a real gap and #764 owns the decision. A planner change should carry its own
# plan-shape arms in a suite CI invokes rather than lean on this one.

# each suite carries, and the two readings are reconciled as SETS, in both

		# WHY THIS EXISTS (#1104), and the first telling of it named the wrong trigger.
		# It is a TAG PUSH, not a schedule. Six scheduled runs on main are green and the
		# only red in the workflow's history is `push ref=v1.0-alpha4`. A branch checkout
		# configures an upstream and `auto` resolves; a tag checkout is DETACHED, has no
		# local branch, and so has no upstream to resolve. That state never had an answer.
		#
		# AND `auto` IS A TAUTOLOGY ON THE SCHEDULED RUNS THAT PASS, which is the better
		# reason for this change. `actions/checkout` fetches refs/heads/main into
		# refs/remotes/origin/main and checks out main at that same sha, so `auto`
		# resolves to origin/main and origin/main IS HEAD. Measured by @OffgridwithJD:
		# a24155b3 against a24155b3. The ceiling was compared against the commit it was
		# read from, every night, and could not have caught a raise. That is exactly the
		# "compared a committed file against itself" failure the --against design refuses
		# one level up.
		#
		# So `parent` does not only give the tag run a prior it lacked. It replaces a
		# comparison that could never fail with one that can.
		#
		# The control for the tag run was in that same run: `upgrade-guard` runs this
		# same script with `fetch-depth: 0` and passed, while all five `suites` jobs
		# failed.
		#
		# WHATEVER SELECTS `parent` MUST ALSO FETCH IT. `HEAD~1` does not exist in a
		# depth-1 checkout, measured, so choosing that policy without `fetch-depth`
		# trades one failure for another. The tool raises rather than falling back.
		# WHICH REF CARRIES THE PRIOR CEILING is resolved by the tool, from
		# GITHUB_BASE_REF in CI or the local main's configured upstream outside
		# it, and it FAILS CLOSED when neither gives a trustworthy answer.
		#
		# It used to be chosen here, preferring origin/main with a printed
		# fallback to HEAD. Both halves were wrong. `origin` is per-clone -- in a
		# contributor's setup it is their fork, measured 446 commits stale -- and
		# comparing against an older main makes the check WEAKER rather than
