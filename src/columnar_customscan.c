/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * pgcolumnar_customscan.c
 *		Planner and executor integration for pgColumnar (spec 8.3, 9).
 *
 * A set_rel_pathlist_hook replaces the sequential-scan path of a columnar
 * base relation with a custom scan path. The custom scan reads only the
 * columns the query references (projection pushdown) and translates the
 * relation's restriction clauses into scan keys, which the reader uses to
 * skip chunk groups whose stored min/max prove they cannot match (qual
 * pushdown, spec 9). The executor always re-applies the full restriction
 * clauses as a filter, so chunk-group skipping is a pure optimization and
 * never changes results: a filtered query returns the same rows whether or
 * not columnar.enable_qual_pushdown is set.
 *
 * The scan is parallel-aware (gap 23): a parallel-aware partial custom path lets
 * the planner Gather over several workers that each claim distinct stripes from
 * a shared atomic counter in the scan's DSM segment.
 *
 * Independent MIT implementation built from
 * design/NATIVE_FORMAT_AND_INTERFACE_SPEC.md and the public PostgreSQL API (the
 * custom-scan provider contract in nodes/extensible.h and
 * executor/nodeCustom.c) only.

 *
 *		A zone map holds col; a predicate about f(col) is about something the

 *		scan reads everything. Measured on a time-clustered fixture: the explicit
 *		range read 2 of 50 chunk groups, `date_trunc('day', ts) = ...` read all
 *		50, for the same 10,000 rows.
 *
 *		Dispatched on funcid rather than written as a branch inside the general
 *		comparison path, because the technique is a function property plus a
 *		rewrite (the objection #369 raised against a special case). Adding a
 *		second function means adding its preimage beside this one.
 *
 *		Being straight about the shape: this inverts exactly one
 *		function, and the step it uses comes from a small table of unit names,
 *		not from date_trunc itself. A month is not a fixed number of seconds, so
 *		the step has to be an interval applied by calendar arithmetic. The
 *		generality is in where the rewrite HAPPENS, not yet in how many
 *		functions it knows.
 *
 *		Equality is the bounded interval: `col >= lo` and `col < hi`, two keys,
 *		returns 2. The ordered operators need ONE bound each and return 1 --
 *		monotonicity is exactly what makes them invertible, so they come from the
 *		same unit table for less work than equality, not more. Returns 0 for
 *		anything it cannot inarguably invert; declining always costs a scan,
 *		never an answer.

 * value must START with, so every match satisfies `col >= prefix` and a group
 * whose maximum is below the prefix holds none of them. `~~` has no btree
 * opfamily strategy, so the clause was dropped before any zone map saw it, and a
 * prefix search read every group. Measured on 20,480 rows in 10 groups: the
 * hand-written range skipped groups and the equivalent LIKE skipped none.
 *
 * Only under the C collation, and that is a correctness condition rather than a
 * conservative choice. "Starts with these bytes" implies "sorts at or after
 * them" under byte ordering; under a collation with ignorable characters it does
 * not, so the bound would not be conservative and could skip a group that really
 * matches. The stored min/max are ordered under the column's own collation
 * (pgcolumnar_write_state.c), so the COLUMN and the comparison must both be C.
 *
 * Scanning the pattern bytewise is safe in every server encoding: all of them
 * are ASCII-compatible, so no continuation byte can be mistaken for '%', '_' or
 * the escape. `col LIKE pat ESCAPE c` does not reach here at all -- it parses as
 * `col ~~ like_escape(pat, c)`, whose right argument is a FuncExpr and not the
 * Const this requires.
 *
 * Both bounds, and the upper one is where most of the pruning comes from: a
 * prefix at the low end of a column's range is satisfied by `>=` everywhere, so
 * a lower bound alone skips nothing there. The successor is the prefix with its
 * last byte incremented, which is exact under byte ordering -- every string
 * between P and that successor shares P's leading bytes, so the range is the
 * prefix set and nothing else.
 *
 * The successor is derived only when the last byte is plain ASCII. Incrementing
 * a byte at or above 0x7F could land inside a multi-byte character and build a
 * text value that is not valid in the server encoding, and the upper bound is an
 * optimisation -- declining to derive it costs a wider scan, which is the side
 * to err on. Returns the number of keys written: 0, 1 (lower only) or 2.

/*
 * pgcolumnar_sorted_pathkeys
 *		The ordering the stored rows are ACTUALLY in, as pathkeys, or NIL (#751).
 *
 *		pgcolumnar.vacuum_sorted physically orders every live row through a
 *		tuplesort, and until #751 nothing told the planner: an ORDER BY on a
 *		table already in that order planned a Sort over the whole scan, and an
 *		ORDER BY ... LIMIT could not stop early.
 *
 *		WHAT MAKES THIS DANGEROUS is that claiming an order the rows are not in
 *		is not a slow plan, it is a WRONG ANSWER: the Sort that would have fixed
 *		the order is removed, so a LIMIT returns the wrong rows and a merge join
 *		matches the wrong ones. No correctness test on unordered data would see
 *		it, because such a test's plan keeps its Sort either way. So every
 *		condition below is a refusal, and the default is NIL.
 *
 *		The rows are in a plain ascending lexicographic order on a known key
 *		only when all of these hold:
 *
 *		1. The last ordering rewrite was a LEXICOGRAPHIC one and said so.
 *		   pgcolumnar.cluster and pgcolumnar.recluster arrange rows on a Z-order
 *		   curve, which is not a sort on any single column, and a NULL kind is a
 *		   storage ordered before pgColumnar recorded which (#758). Both are
 *		   refused here rather than guessed at, and neither can be told from a
 *		   sorted run by the run extent alone.
 *
 *		2. Every row group lies inside the recorded run [sorted_from,
 *		   sorted_through]. A group above it was appended after the rewrite, in
 *		   insert order; a group below it was written by a concurrent writer
 *		   whose stripe id was drawn first (#342). Either way the relation is a
 *		   sorted run plus rows that are not in it, which is a merge and not a
 *		   scan. An UPDATE lands in an appended group, so this also retracts the
 *		   claim after any row is updated.
 *
 *		3. No sort key column is collatable. Only the column names are recorded,
 *		   so nothing can tell whether the collation the rewrite sorted under is
 *		   still the column's collation, and a collation-only ALTER changes it
 *		   without rewriting a single row. See the refusal below for the measured
 *		   wrong answer this prevents.
 *
 *		4. The requested ordering is a PREFIX of the recorded key, ascending,
 *		   NULLS LAST, in the key's own collation. That is exactly what
 *		   pgcolumnar_compact_relation's tuplesort applies: the type's default
 *		   '<' operator, the column's own collation, nullsFirst = false. Asking
 *		   build_expression_pathkey for that same '<' operator reproduces those
 *		   three properties rather than restating them, so the claim cannot
 *		   drift from the sort that produced it.
 *
 *		The scan returns groups in ascending group number (the reader sorts the
 *		list with row_group_cmp) and rows within a group in stored order, so a
 *		run that covers every group is returned in the order the rewrite wrote
 *		it. Deleted rows are skipped, which removes rows but does not reorder
 *		the ones that remain.
 *
 *		Column identity is by NAME, because that is what sorted_by records. A
 *		renamed or dropped sort column stops resolving and the claim lapses,
 *		which is the safe direction.
 *
 *		Only the serial scan may use this. The parallel path hands whole stripes
 *		to workers that finish in any order, and a projection is a different
 *		physical layout with its own sort key.

	 * Nothing in this query could use an ordering, so do not go and find out

	 * which grows with the relation, and every claim this function could return
	 * here would be truncated to NIL by truncate_useless_pathkeys at the end
	 * anyway. Same notion, computed before the expensive part instead of after
	 * it.
	 *
	 * Measured before this early return, 1,000,000 rows in 1,000 groups, a
	 * relation marked lexicographic, a query with no ORDER BY, planning time
	 * from EXPLAIN (SUMMARY ON) over 15 interleaved reps: 1.079 ms against
	 * 0.922 ms with the feature off, 1.17x. The control that makes it mechanism
	 * rather than noise is a never-sorted relation, which returns at condition 1
	 * and measured 1.01x.
	 *
	 * Declared in optimizer/paths.h with this signature on every supported
	 * major, immediately above truncate_useless_pathkeys.
	 *
	 * THE TWO ARE NOT THE SAME PREDICATE, and the equivalence relied on here
	 * comes from planner.c rather than from either function body.
	 * truncate_useless_pathkeys counts more sources than has_useful_pathkeys
	 * tests, and neither list is stable across majors:
	 *
	 *   major     truncate counts                              has_useful tests
	 *   PG15/16   merging, ordering                             merging, query_pathkeys
	 *   PG17      merging, ordering, grouping, setop            merging, group, query_pathkeys
	 *   PG18      merging, ordering, grouping, distinct, setop  merging, group, query_pathkeys
	 *   PG19      merging, sort, window, setop, group, distinct merging, query_pathkeys
	 *
	 * Read that way, a query whose only use for an ordering is DISTINCT or a
	 * set operation looks like it would be skipped here while the old code kept
	 * the claim. It is not, because standard_qp_callback assigns
	 * root->query_pathkeys from whichever clause the query has -- group, else
	 * window, else distinct, else sort, else setop, else NIL -- so every source
	 * truncate counts beyond merging is one of the five that funnel into
	 * query_pathkeys. has_useful_pathkeys false therefore implies
	 * truncate_useless_pathkeys would have returned NIL. Read in planner.c and
	 * pathkeys.c on 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.
	 *
	 * The right-hand column is itself the evidence that the funnel is deliberate
	 * rather than incidental. PG17 added grouping to truncate AND a group_pathkeys
	 * test to has_useful; PG19 REMOVED that test again while keeping grouping in
	 * truncate, which is only correct because group_pathkeys reaches
	 * query_pathkeys. Core relies on the same identity this does.
	 *
	 * It is still worth stating, because it is the assumption a later major can
	 * break. If those five stop funnelling through query_pathkeys -- PG19 has
	 * already restructured this area once -- this early return starts dropping
	 * legitimate claims SILENTLY, and no test can see it: the result is a lost
	 * optimisation, not a wrong answer.
	 *
	 * The risk that carries is bounded, and by the same yardstick the collation
	 * refusal below uses. This is not a novel shortcut: it is the guard core puts
	 * in front of a btree index's pathkeys. indxpath.c gates, builds, then
	 * truncates, in that order, on every supported major:
	 *
	 *     pathkeys_possibly_useful = (scantype != ST_BITMAPSCAN &&
	 *                                 has_useful_pathkeys(root, rel));
	 *     if (index_is_ordered && pathkeys_possibly_useful) {
	 *         index_pathkeys = build_index_pathkeys(...);
	 *         useful_pathkeys = truncate_useless_pathkeys(root, rel, index_pathkeys);
	 *     }
	 *
	 * has_useful_pathkeys has three callers in core and that one is structurally
	 * identical to this. So if the funnel ever breaks, an ordered index on the
	 * same column loses the same optimisation in the same query. No weaker than
	 * an index is the bar, and it is met.

 * pgcolumnar_index_fetch_penalty
 *		extra cost to add to a heap-fetching columnar index scan for the row-group
 *		decodes its per-row fetches force. Core's cost_index prices a heap fetch as
 *		a page or two; a columnar fetch decodes the whole row group the row lives in
 *		(pgcolumnar_reader.c, PgColumnarReadRowByNumber), which is why the planner picks
 *		an index scan for an unclustered ORDER BY and then runs for minutes (#355).
 *
 * A statement-scoped cache (issue #143) means a group is decoded once per scan, not
 * once per row, so the count that matters is how many *distinct* groups the fetched
 * rows fall into:
 *
 *   - fully clustered (rho -> 1, or a TID-ordered bitmap heap scan): the rows sit in
 *     ceil(rows / R) adjacent groups, the floor.
 *   - fully scattered (rho -> 0): every fetched row can land in its own group, up to
 *     one decode per row, the ceiling.
 *   - between: interpolate on rho^2, the share of ordering variance the correlation
 *     explains, matching how cost_index already blends min and max page cost.
 *
 * The one exception is the fetch cache cliff (#359): when one group's decoded width
 * exceeds the cache cap it is never retained, so every fetch re-decodes regardless of
 * clustering -- the ceiling, unconditionally. (When #359 makes that overflow
 * proportional rather than total, this branch should soften with it.)
 *
 * decode_per_group is one group's cost: its pages read once, plus the per-value
 * decode of R rows across the columns the scan needs.
 *
 * That is not the whole fetch. Even after the group is in the statement-scoped
 * cache, each row still pays tuple reconstruction and group location that a heap
 * fetch does not. Without a per-row term the clustered penalty is independent of
 * how many rows are fetched, so a 50,000-row correlated range stays on the index
 * while doing about 27x the work of the custom scan (#913). cpu_tuple_cost is the
 * same unit core already uses for a heap tuple; decodeUnits is the projection in
 * #503's 4-byte-column units. Do not scale this from heap instructions-per-cost:
 * #766 showed that conversion predicts the wrong winner.
 *
 * Cap the per-row term at half a group. Uncapped it grows with the whole table
 * and costs a clustered ORDER BY off its index, which #355 must not do. Half a
 * group is enough to move the 50,000-row range and small enough to leave the
 * ordered scan on the index.

 *		non-assert, with the metadata and fold paths off so the scan really decodes:
 *
 *			marginal cost of one more projected column
 *			  int4           4 bytes     24.0 ms
 *			  text (md5)    36 bytes    247.0 ms	10.29x, for 9.00x the bytes
 *			  text (long)  324 bytes   1420.3 ms
 *
 *		and what the planner charged, after ANALYZE, for the whole projection:
 *
 *			8 int4                     206,524   at   335 ms
 *			4 text (324 bytes)         163,422   at  5875 ms
 *
 *		Four long-text columns priced BELOW eight int columns while taking 17.5x
 *		as long: a 22x under-charge, and in the direction that makes the planner
 *		prefer the plan that is slower (#768).
 *
 *		Decode cost tracks BYTES. Per byte, text measured 1.14x an int4 on the md5
 *		fixture, and across an 81x width range the per-byte figures span 0.45x to
 *		1.36x -- within ~1.5x, against 59x for a per-column model. The profile says
 *		the same thing: the text arm's self time is 15.60% __memmove_avx against
 *		2.88% on the int arm, so the extra time is spent copying the extra bytes.
 *
 *		Width is divided by COLUMNAR_DECODE_REF_WIDTH so that a 4-byte column
 *		contributes exactly 1.0 and an int-only projection is priced exactly as
 *		#503 priced it. That is deliberate: it keeps the existing calibration for
 *		the narrow case that #503 was tuned against, and changes only the wide
 *		case that was wrong.
 *
 *		The per-column floor of 1.0 exists because decoding a value is not free
 *		even when the value is one byte: a bool column still costs a validity
 *		check, a rank, and a store. Without the floor this would REDUCE the charge
 *		for narrow columns below what #503 measured, which nothing here justifies.
 *
 *		Width comes from ANALYZE's stored average, with get_typavgwidth as the
 *		fallback, for the reason given on the width fraction below: a varlena

	 * 3,998 rows of 100,000,000. The un-bounded penalty reached 502,598,685,066
	 * on that query -- 207,000 times the un-penalized path -- so even the 1/25000
	 * of it that the skip scan fractions to still lost to a full scan and a sort.
	 * Measured: 44,058 ms for the plan chosen, 769 ms for the one refused.
	 *
	 * Why bound rather than model it better: the two cases cannot be told apart
	 * from this hook. Both have a leading-key correlation of about zero. What
	 * differs is which groups the fetched rows land in, and that is not knowable
	 * before the consumer exists. Measured both ways on the same shape -- a
	 * consumer that reads every row makes the penalty right by 36x (4,710 ms
	 * against 170,965), and one that stops early makes it wrong by 57x.
	 *
	 * Past some multiple of a full scan the number stops carrying information a
	 * planner can use. Any path priced above the scan already loses to it, so
	 * further inflation only harms a consumer that fractions the path. The bound
	 * keeps the direction and drops the part that only does damage.
	 *
	 * The multiple is empirical, not derived. It is chosen to sit inside a window
	 * both measurements agree on: the early-stopping case needs the penalty cut by
	 * at least 1.45x, and the read-everything case tolerates roughly 16,000x
	 * before it picks the wrong plan. Twenty is near the conservative end of that
	 * window, so the penalty keeps steering where it was steering correctly.
	 * test/analyze_stats.sh pins both directions.
